# DSA C++ Template

This repo is for quickly setting up a C++ project that uses [CMake](https://cmake.org) and [GoogleTest](https://google.github.io/googletest/).  

It is intended for practice with the C++ language while doing Data Structures and  
Algorithms problems like those found on [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com)

## Instructions

1 - Clone the repo to a directory name of your choice.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jgndev/dsa_cpp_templ example_problem
```

2 - Run the project init script `project-init.sh`

```bash
./project-init.sh
```

This creates a `build` directory and links `compile-commands.json` to the top level which
helps LSPs work in editors like [neovim](https://neovim.io).

## Building

1 - Change directory into `build`

2 - Run `make`


## Running tests

1 - Add your tests to `tests/test_solution.cpp`

2 - Change directory to `build`

3 - Run `make` to compile `test_solution`

4 - Run `./test_solution` to run the tests.

## 2540. Minimum Common Value

Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, return the minimum 
integer common to both arrays. If there is no common integer amongst nums1 and nums2, return -1.

Note that an integer is said to be common to nums1 and nums2 if both arrays have at least one 
occurrence of that integer.


Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The smallest element common to both arrays is 2, so we return 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,6], nums2 = [2,3,4,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two common elements in the array 2 and 3 out of which 2 is the smallest, so 2 is returned.


Constraints:

1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 105
1 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109
Both nums1 and nums2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
